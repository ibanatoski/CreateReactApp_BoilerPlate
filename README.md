# Naming Convention
### ```/folderName/FileName.jsx```
 - **folders** - All folder names should be lowercase and camel case. (Ex. ```/components/ProfileCard.jsx```)
 - **Files** - All file names should have their first letter Capitalized and the first letter of following words Capitalized. (Ex. ```/components/ProfileCard.jsx```)

# Folder Structure
 - ``/api`` - Where all api calls live, also include data formating with returned data
 - ``/components`` - Where all React components
 - ``/css`` - If you have a compiler built in then this is where all compiled SCSS files would live as CSS files
 - ``/scss`` - Where all scss (aka SASS) files live
 - ``/pages`` - Where all main pages of an application live (essentially where all routes live)
